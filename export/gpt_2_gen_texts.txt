LONDON â€” An investigation by New Street suggests that the London Underground is in breach of its own rules surrounding public water supply.

The British Transport Police (BTP) said it was examining the incident at the A30 Tube station on Tuesday evening and could not comment further on the matter. A spokesman for the BTP said: "BTP will investigate any allegations that the BTP has breached the London Underground's public water supply rules."

The inspector, who was deputed to examine the water supply, said it was "very surprising" the train station was not being used as a public water source. "We can't comment further on the matter," he added.

An A30 subway train was left unattended by its driver after the incident, which happened an hour and a half after the Tube was brought in and stopped.

An investigation into the incident found there was no breach of the London Underground's public water supply rules.

The BTP said it was investigating the incident and that the BTP would provide the details of its findings.

It added that the BTP was "unable to comment further" on the matter.

An A30 train carrying the A30 Tolls was left unattended by its driver.

A spokesperson for the BTP said the BTP made the decision to end the service on Tuesday evening after the incident.

The train was carrying a health facility with eight people before it derailed.

A spokesperson for the BTP said: "The A30 train is running a high-pressure water system. We are investigating the incident and will provide the details of its findings."

The BTP said the station was vital to the financial viability of the city.

The BTP said it had had no problems with the public water supply.

The BTP said: "The BTP has not been affected by any incidents whatsoever. The BTP is concerned that this is a potential safety issue but does not believe it to be an issue that is causing any problems."<|endoftext|>Hardcore R&B artist and rapper, Faith Evans, has died.
