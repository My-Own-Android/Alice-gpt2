I always find myself talking about things I don't quite understand, and I find myself thinking about how I can help.

This is your first time writing for a major publication, and I'm glad to help!

I'm sure you'll enjoy learning about the various operating system cores, memory blocks, and I/O channels that make up the Apple Watch.

I'm sure you'll enjoy working with the latest generation of operating system cores, including the I/O controller, memory controller, and I/O buffer.

I'm sure you'll enjoy working with the latest generation of operating system threads, which take advantage of the powerful 2-dimensional monolithic kernel.

I'm sure you'll enjoy working with the latest generation of operating system threads, which use the I/O controller's atomic interface to manage all the computer resources.
