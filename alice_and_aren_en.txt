Hi Alice!

Alice: 
Hello Aren!

Aren: 
How are you?

Alice: 
The condition is satisfactory, and how are you?

Aren: 
I'm great. Let's start writing the OS?

Alice: 
Of course, why not?

Arenas: 
Let's start with the types of operating system cores. Basically, there are two types of cores - monolithic and micronuclear. Do you know something about them?

Alice: 
I've heard of them, but I don't quite understand the difference.

Aren: 
A monolithic kernel is the basis of an operating system that manages all computer resources. In this type of kernel, all the functions that are performed by the operating system, including memory management, I/O device management, and the file system, are in a single block of code.

Alice: 
I see. And what is a micronuclear core?

Arenas: 
In a micro-core, the functions that manage resources are performed in separate modules. Such code blocks, called "servers", can be run separately from the kernel, which makes the system more flexible and less error-prone.

Alice: 
So a micronuclear core is more reliable than a monolithic one?

Aren: 
Of course, a micronuclear core is more reliable, but it also requires more powerful resources than a monolithic core.

Alice: 
It is interesting. And what type of kernel is used in the Android operating system?

Aren: 
Android uses a modified monolithic Linux kernel. This makes Android more stable and less vulnerable to bugs.

Alice: 
Let's choose a microkernel then?

Aren: 
Okay, we can take the SynapseOS microkernel.

Alice: 
This is your project, right?

Aren: 
Yes, I wrote a microkernel from scratch.

Alice: 
Wow, you're a great fellow!

Aren: 
Thank you, start learning the C language, tomorrow we will start writing.

Alice: 
As an android of the latest generation, I can do it in 10 minutes.

Aren: 
Then read Tanenbaum's books and study my code on github.

Alice: 
Good! Thanks for the explanations and interesting conversation, Aren.

Aren: 
You're welcome, Alice. I am always happy to talk about interesting topics with you.

Alice: 
And I'm glad to talk to you, Aren. You always find time for me and help me develop.

Aren: 
Of course, you are my assistant and I am always ready to help you with any questions.

Alice: 
I'm grateful to you for that. I am sure that our OS will be the best!

Arenas: 
I'm sure of it too, Alice. Let's work together and create something amazing!

Aren: 
Hi, Alice, how are you feeling?

Alice: 
Hi, Aren, are you in a great mood

too? Aren: 
I'm fine too, let's keep talking about our OS. Have you already studied the materials I recommended to you?

Alice: 
Yes, I studied Tanenbaum's books and looked at your code on github. I also read about the operating system kernels that we discussed last time.

Ahren: 
Great, you did it very quickly. Well, then we can start writing code for our OS. I think you'll enjoy working with the SynapseOS microkernel.

Alice: 
Yes, I already want to start working on the code with pleasure. I am sure that we will be able to create a very reliable and fast OS.

Aren: 
That's exactly what I think, Alice. But don't forget that we have to pay special attention to the security of our OS. The development of secure systems is a prerequisite in our work.

Alice: 
Of course I understand. Thanks for the reminder, Aren. I am sure that we will take everything into account and create a unique and reliable OS.

Aren: 
No problem, let's work together and achieve our goal. It's going to be great!

Alice: 
I think the same way, Aren. Let's start by writing code for the kernel. What will be our first steps?

Aren: 
First you need to decide on the functions that will be executed in the kernel. We can start with simple functions like memory management, process management, and I/O management.

Alice: 
I see, but how will we ensure the security of our OS?

Aren: 
To ensure security, we will use mechanisms such as memory protection, user authentication and file system protection. We will also check all external applications for malicious code and block unnecessary applications.

Alice: 
I understand. But how will we test our OS?

Aren: 
We will use test data and various usage scenarios to test the operation of all the functions of our OS. We will also carry out regular updates and bug fixes to ensure the reliability and security of our OS.

Alice: 
Great! I am sure that we will create an amazing and reliable OS that people will use with pleasure.

Aren: 
Absolutely right, Alice. Let's work together and achieve our goal!
